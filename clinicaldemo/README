This README provides instructions on loading the clinical demonstrator code as implemented at UF. Note, you may need to change the SPARQL endpoint URL to correctly retrieve desired data.


1) Open the template individual--foaf-person.ftl in /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/vivo/templates/freemarker/body/individual.
2) After the <#-- Positions --> block (ends on line 118 in VIVO 1.4.1 version as used by UF), insert the directive:
<#include "tag-cloud.html">
3) Copy the tag-cloud.html file to the same directory. (/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/vivo/templates/freemarker/body/individual)
4) Reload the page. Restarting VIVO is generally not necessary as VIVO checks for alterations to the templates on a regular basis and should serve them immediately. Browse to an individual person's page to load the elements.
