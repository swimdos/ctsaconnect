Change log and basic project documentation
==================================


05/25/2012
- Started moving string constants to Const class in the "common" package
- Started to create static utility methods in the "OWLUtil" class that help with working with the OWL API. Javadoc will be added later. They are prefixed with "u" for "utility" and they can be imported by using a static import as seen in "UmlsOwlClassGenerator"
- Added a "OWLFiles_generated" folder for generated files. This folder is git ignored to avoid publishing these files to google code.
- When we have a better understanding of what can be published from the UMLS and other sources, we will move generated files to the "OWLFiles_published" folder.
- Run the "UmlsOwlClassGenerator" class to generate ICD9CM and CPT2012 classes. This class needs a standard database installation of the UMLS and the connection parameters need to be set as described below.
- There is a class "DBInfoExample" that needs to be copied to "DBInfo" and the correct database connection parameters set in the copied class. The copy will be ignored by git so that your connection information is not uploaded to the repository.
- The code will be autoformated as needed but annotations can be added to prevent the auto formatting of a section of code or comments. The annotations are "//@formatter:on" and "//@formatter:off" to turn formatting on or off from the annotation line downwards. (see "createInstances.java" around line 80 and 160 for an example.)
